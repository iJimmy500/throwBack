This was the project that me and my team made over a weekend at rowdyhacksX (Created by James, Alex, Noah and Alex)
This python program connects to the Last.FM api in order to find the songs a user has listened to on that day years ago (from 2021- present)
This used many libraries including Tkinter, PIL and many others
